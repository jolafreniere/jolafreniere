Hey there, I'm Joe!

- I've been mostly doing nodejs personal projects lately, some of them involving OCR/UI interaction
- I kinda know my way around Express, TypeScript, Github Actions, WebSockets, Jest testing... node backend stuff mostly
- You can reach me through my email: jonathan.lafreniere@gmail.com

I'm keeping track of stuff i'm learning about in this repo, as well as some of my other public repositories. Feel free to take a look/send feedback!
